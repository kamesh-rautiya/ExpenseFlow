## 📝 Description

ExpenseFlow is a tool for **managing personal finances** that allows users to create and categorize records, analyze income
and expenses, and manage multiple accounts.

The backend was written in **Java** using the **Spring framework** and uses a MySql database for data persistence. The
frontend is a single-page application connected via REST API and built with TypeScript, **Vue.js**, and Vuetify.

## ⚽️ Project Goals

I created this project for several reasons. Firstly, I wanted to **experiment with various technologies**. Secondly, I
aimed to experience all stages of the software development cycle. Additionally, I intended to add work to my portfolio
that would demonstrate my development skills.

## 🏗️ Realization

To begin, I made a list of the **necessary features** and selected the appropriate technologies, and then started
developing the backend server.

I developed the **backend** in **Java** and **Spring** framework and chose the MySql database for data persistence. The
application utilizes the **MVC architecture**. The database runs in a **Docker** container. Authentication and
authorization are provided by **JWT token** using **Spring Security**. The API
generates [Open Api](https://janbabak.github.io/ExpenseFlow-BE/) documentation automatically. Additionally, I created
[documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13190557/2s93CRKWwv#b9ffcedf-337f-4546-8095-5740e9047e96) for the
API using Postman, which includes example requests and responses.

## 🚀 Features

- Multiple financial accounts
- Add records and categorize them
- Analytic of categories, incomes, expenses, cash flow...
- Charts
- Responsive web interface

## 🧑‍🔬 Technologies

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [Spring](https://spring.io)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [MySql](https://www.mysql.com)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)

## ❌ Issues

During the development, I encountered some issues. One of them was adding filtering and sorting parameters to the "get
all records" endpoint. To solve this problem, I used the specification-arg-resolver library which can map request
parameters to Jpa specifications and extended the record repository by PagingAndSortingRepository, and
JpaSpecificationExecutor.

## 😁 Conclusion

I originally planned to create a much smaller project but finished with a larger one. I **gained new knowledge** during
development - for instance, how to elegantly add **filtering parameters** to the API endpoint or use **JPQL** for more
complex database queries. So, I am satisfied with the result of my work.

## ✅ Software requirements

- Java 17
- Docker, Docker compose

## 🎬 How to run

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babakjan/ExpenseFlow-BE.git
cd ExpenseFlow-BE/
```

### Start database

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Start the app

- Set the development environment. The app will connect to the local database.
  ```bash
  export spring_profiles_active=dev
  ```
- Create database schema - open `./src/main/resources/application.yml` set the value of `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`
  to `create`.
- Run the app (app will run on http://localhost:8000/api)
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
- If you want to initiate the database with test data, stop the app and undo the changes you've done in the application
  properties file (set `create` to `none`), plus make sure, that the `spring.sql.init.mode` has value `always`.
- run the app again
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
- If you want to run the app repeatedly, change the previously added `always` to `never` line because you don't want to
  insert test data every time you restart the app.

- Swagger documentation of running app can be found at http://localhost:8000/api/swagger-ui/index.html
